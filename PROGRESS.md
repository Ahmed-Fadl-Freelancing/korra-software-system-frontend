# Korra — Cross-Repo Progress & Roadmap

> **Single source of truth shared by BOTH repos.** This exact file lives in
> `Korra-Software-System-Backend` and `korra-software-system-frontend` and must be
> kept **identical** in both. When you finish an issue in either repo, update this
> file in that repo and copy it to the other (or paste the diff).
>
> Legend: `[BE]` backend repo · `[FE]` frontend repo · ✅ Done · 🔧 In Progress · 🔲 Todo · 📋 Backlog
>
> Linear: Team **Korrra** (key `KOR`). One PR **per feature (milestone group)**, never per issue.
> Branch convention (new work): **`feat/<Name>`** (e.g. `feat/Auth`).
> Last updated: 2026-06-16 — KOR-53 merged to main (PR #3). KOR-117–121 created for User Profile & Department Routing, status: In Progress. Branch: feat/UserProfile
>
> **Brand:** Card palette = Blue · White · Silver. All UI must follow this. See `ISSUES.md` → Brand Identity for exact tokens.

## ▶ NEXT UP

| Repo | Issue | Title | Branch | Status |
|------|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| **[FE]** | **KOR-117–121** | User Profile & Department Routing — GET /me, AuthContext profile, DepartmentRedirect, ProtectedRoute guards, Topbar | `feat/UserProfile` | 🔧 In Progress |

---

## Milestone 2 — Auth Foundation & Session

**Branch:** `feat/Auth` (BE new work) · earlier BE work landed on `feature/auth-foundation`

| Repo | Issue | Title | Status |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
| [BE] | KOR-83 | `SupabaseJWTAuthentication` — local HS256 verify with `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` | ✅ Done |
| [BE] | KOR-84 | `GET /me` — profile + department + roles | ✅ Done |
| [BE] | KOR-85 | `GET /health` — liveness probe | ✅ Done |
| [BE] | KOR-113 | `POST /auth/signup` — proxy to Supabase Auth | 🔧 In Review (PR #2) |
| [BE] | KOR-114 | `POST /auth/login` — password grant, relays Supabase tokens | 🔧 In Review (PR #2) |
| [BE] | KOR-115 | `POST /auth/logout` — revoke Supabase session | 🔧 In Review (PR #2) |
| [BE] | KOR-116 | `POST /auth/refresh` — refresh-token grant | 🔧 In Review (PR #2) |
| [FE] | KOR-53 | Auth foundation — Backend Proxy (`/auth/*`), `AuthContext`, signIn/signUp/signOut | ✅ Done (merged) |
| [FE] | KOR-54 | App Layout — AppLayout, AppSidebar, Topbar skeleton | ✅ Done |
| [FE] | KOR-117 | GET /me — restore user profile fetch after login | 🔧 In Progress |
| [FE] | KOR-118 | AuthContext — expose user profile, hasDepartment, hasRole, departmentName | 🔧 In Progress |
| [FE] | KOR-119 | Department-based routing — /app → /app/sales or /app/tech | 🔧 In Progress |
| [FE] | KOR-120 | ProtectedRoute — department null guard + role/section guards | 🔧 In Progress |
| [FE] | KOR-121 | Topbar — display user full_name, department badge, manager badge | 🔧 In Progress |

> **Architecture note:** Django never mints its own JWT. The `/auth/*` endpoints
> forward credentials to **Supabase Auth (GoTrue)**; Supabase issues the
> access/refresh tokens, and every later request is verified **locally** by
> `SupabaseJWTAuthentication`. The frontend may still call Supabase directly —
> the backend endpoints are an equivalent server-side path.

## How to use this file

1. Look at **▶ NEXT UP** to find the next issue — for **either** repo.
2. If the next issue is tagged for the **other** repo, switch to that repo and open
   its copy of this file / Linear to get the canonical id, then work there.
3. One branch + one PR per **milestone feature group**, not per issue.
4. After each issue: flip its status here, commit, and keep both repos' copies in sync.
